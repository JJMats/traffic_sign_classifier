    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For my first step, I chose to convert a copy of the training set images to grayscale, and then augment them into the RGB image set. The goal here was to increase the quantity of images to train on, while promoting color channel invariance of the classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then normalized all of the images in the training, testing, and validation datasets because it reduces the work that the optimizer has to do by keeping the mean of the data set near zero and a nearly equal variance about the mean.\n",

Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
