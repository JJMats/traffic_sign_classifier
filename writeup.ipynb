    "\n",
    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the training data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data is not evenly distributed for each label. There are major differences in quantities of each label which may induce bias in the final model towards the labels with the greater counts.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For my first step, I chose to convert a copy of the training set images to grayscale, and then augment them into the RGB image set. The goal here was to increase the quantity of images to train on, while promoting color channel invariance of the classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an image before and after grayscaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageGray]\n",
    "\n",
    "I then decided to generate randomly scaled images with a 2 pixel growth/shrink constraint. This data was generated from the RGB/Grayscale augmented training dataset, and then also augmented into the training data set to assist with scale invariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an image that has been scaled is:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][imageScaled]\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I proceeded to apply a random image translation generator to the augmented dataset that was constrained with a 3 pixel x and y directional constraint. This data was then augmented into the training data set to improve translation invariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an image that has been translated is:\n",
    "![alt text][imageTranslate]\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final step, I normalized all of the images in the training, testing, and validation datasets because it reduces the work that the optimizer has to do by keeping the mean of the data set near zero and a nearly equal variance about the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to augment the data because I believe that it will help the model generalize better, while attaining improved accuracy. As a result of these operations, the augmented training data set grew from 34,799 images to 278,392 images. This provided much more data to train the COVNET on. I did split 20% of the data into a new validation dataset, so the resulting dataset sizes were:\n",

    "* Split Augmented Training Data Set Size: 222,713 Images\n",
    "* New Validation Data Set Size: 55,679 Images\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I used an Adam Optimizer. The hyperparameters that I tuned are as follows:\n",
    "* Batch Size: 128 Objects\n",
    "* Epoch Count: 30\n",
    "* Learning Rate: 0.0005\n",
    "* Dropout Keep Probability: 50.0%\n",
    "* LeNet mu: 0\n",
    "* LeNet sigma: 0.08\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose an epoch count of 30 because of the size of the dataset and the long time duration that was required to process each epoch. Accuracy gains also flattened before the 30th epoch was reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* Training set accuracy of 99.1%\n",
    "* Provided validation set accuracy of 97.5%\n",
    "* Split validation set accuracy of 98.5%\n",
    "* Test set accuracy of 96.0%\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose an interative approach to solve this problem, but I started with the LeNet-5 architecture. I decided to start with this base because it has been proven to perform well in object classification problems and it can be tuned to improve scaling, translation, rotation, and color invariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original architecture utilized two convolutional layers with RELU activation functions followed by max pooling operations, and then three fully connected layers with RELU functions. In an effort to improve the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting, I later added a dropout function to the fully-connected layers that did seem to help with the web image dataset classification. The code for the LeNet architecture is in code cell 20 of Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmenting the training dataset also helped improve the accuracy of the model against the all of the datasets. The augmentation functions I chose to incorporate were scaling, translating, and grayscaling the images. These functions were applied to all of the images existing in the augmented training set and effectively doubled the training dataset size each time one was applied. These augmentation functions were performed in code cells 10 - 16. The data was then normalized in code cell 17, and then a second validation dataset was generated from the augmented training data in code cell 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran multiple training operations while tuning various hyperparameters to improve the model's classification accuracy. I found a learning rate of 0.0005 over 30 epochs to perform fairly well. The accuracy improvement reaches a point of diminishing returns near epoch 11, so stopping training earlier may help reduce overfitting. I found that reducing the sigma value of the truncated_normal operation in the LeNet convolutional layers from 0.10 to 0.08 helped improve classification accuracy as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the dropout function, effort was applied in finding an optimal dropout ratio and which layers to apply it to. In my final model, I decided to only apply the dropout function to the fully-connected layers. I chose a dropout ratio of 50.0% to assist in model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model resulted in high accuracy in all of the provided data sets, and it achieved 80% accuracy on the web image classification. The output can be seen in code cell 24. The model may still benefit from additional augmentation and image filtering methods to reduce any potential overfitting, while improving the ability of the model to generalize.\n",

    "#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.\n",

    "#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set.
